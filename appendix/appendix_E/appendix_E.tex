\ltx{} is implemented as a \TeX{} ``macro package''-a series of predefined \TeX{}
commands.Plain \TeX{} is the standard version of \TeX{},consisting of ``raw'' \TeX{}
plus the plain macro package. You can use Plain \TeX{} commands to do some
things that you can't with standard \ltx{} commands.However,before using
Plain \TeX{}, check the \ltx{} Companion to see if there is a package that does
what you want.
