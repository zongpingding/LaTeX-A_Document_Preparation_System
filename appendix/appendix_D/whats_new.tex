This appendix lists most of the differences between \ltx{} 2.09, the original 
version of \ltx{}, and the current version, \ltxee{}.

\section*{Document Styles and Style Options}
Documents prepared for \ltxee{} begin with a \cmd{\documentclass} command 
(Section 2.2.2). \ltxee{} realizes it is processing a \ltx{} 2.09 input file and enters
\textit{compatibility mode} when it encounters a \ltx{} 2.09 \cmd{\documentstyle} command.
Most \ltx{} 2.09 input files will work with \ltxee{}. However, an error may
occur if \ltxee{} reads an auxiliary file produced by \ltx{} 2.09, so it's a good
idea to delete such files before running \ltxee{}.

The document styles of \ltx{} 2.09 have become document classes. \hologo{SliTeX}
has been eliminated; slides are produced using the \texttt{slides} document class. 
Standard document-style options that controlled formatting, such as \texttt{twoside}, have
become document-class options, and are specified as optional arguments to the
\cmd{\documentclass} command. Other document-style options have become packages, 
loaded with the \cmd{\usepackage} command (Section 2.2.2). Most nonstandard
document-style options will work as \ltxee{} packages.
